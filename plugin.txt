name "Guided Start and Neutrality"
about "Have you ever had trouble getting the free worlds campaign to start, or accidentally failed a key mission? Have you ever thought that all sides were equally bad or wanted to join an unimplemented side? This plugin helps you get started on the Free Worlds campaign, removing otherwise permanent blockers, and it refers you to the Crisis in Management plugin and helps you get started on its Syndicate campaign. This feature is called 'guided start' and you will be prompted on whether or not you want to enable this for a given run. Additionally, this plugin adds a short mission chain that allows you to skip the war and remain neutral, which can either be done with guided start or manually by not choosing sides until 3023, insiting that you are neutral, then landing on a planet near the Pug worlds."
