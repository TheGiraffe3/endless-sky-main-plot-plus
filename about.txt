Have you ever had trouble getting the Free Worlds campaign to start, or accidentally failed a key mission?
Have you ever thought that all sides were equally bad or wanted to join an unimplemented side?
Have you ever wondered what happened to the Mark II Syndicate ships?
Well, you won't be able to join the Navy, and joining the Syndicate requires the 'Crisis in Management' plugin, but otherwise, this plugin is for you.
