Some text was paraphrased or copied verbatim from files in the video game "Endless Sky." The files that the text was taken from are all copyright Michael Zahniser and licensed under the GPL v3 or later. Comments on the data files will say what text was copied. This means that this plugin can be considered modified from the base game. The data files were "free worlds 3 checkmate.txt" and "pug missions.txt"

NOTE: This was originally donated to the public domain, however, I am not sure if I am allowed to do that given that I have copied text from a work licensed under the GPL v3 or later. I have relicensed it under the GPL to make sure that I am not violating any rules. I would therefore recommend following the GPL v3 anyways.
