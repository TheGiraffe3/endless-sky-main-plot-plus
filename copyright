Some text was paraphrased or copied verbatim from files in the video game "Endless Sky." The files that the text was taken from are all copyright Michael Zahniser and licensed under the GPL v3 or later, with the exception of "syndicate jobs.txt," copyright Michael Zahniser and Nate Graham, "hai reveal 0 prologue.txt," copyright MasterOfGrey, and "post-war reactions.txt," anonymously copyrighted, both of which are also licensed under the GPL v3 or later. Comments on the data files will say what text was copied. This means that this plugin can be considered modified from the base game. The data files were "campaign events.txt," "human missions.txt," "free worlds 1 start.txt," "free worlds 3 checkmate.txt," "syndicate jobs.txt," "hai reveal 0 prologue.txt," "pug missions.txt," and "post-war reactions.txt"

I additionally took a partial screenshot of part of the game to use in one of the missions. The game's source code itself is copyright Michael Zahniser and other contributors* and licensed under the GPL v3 or later. It is available at https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky. The images of the outfits are copyright Becca Tomasso and licensed under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license, and the frame images are copyright Michael Zahniser and also licensed under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license.

Improvements to the "free worlds checkmate.txt" file, copyright Michael Zahniser, made by Amazinite, were used for "improved checkmate.txt" and can be found at https://github.com/Amazinite/endless-sky/tree/fw-improved-checkmate, with the exception of the augmented nuclear missile stats, which are modifications to the "weapons.txt" file, copyright Michael Zahniser, made by Azure3141, and available at https://github.com/Azure3141/endless-sky/tree/nuke-buff.

NOTE: This was originally donated to the public domain, however, I am not sure if I am allowed to do that given that I have copied text from a work licensed under the GPL v3 or later. I have relicensed it under the GPL to make sure that I am not violating any rules. I would therefore recommend following the GPL v3 anyways.
